# ADF4351_Driver
Simple driver to adjust frequency on the ADF 4351 chip.
When working on my capstone project I needed a driver but the ones on github that I have found didnt work, and LLMs didnt work. I eventually manually went into the datasheet to write the code ([ADF4351 Datasheet](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ADF4351.pdf)).

see examples for working examples.
